# BlackSabbathOfficialSite
This is a remake of official site of heavy metal group Black Sabbath using various modern JavaScript technologies

Original site: 
https://www.blacksabbath.com/home.html

As soon as existing functionality is implemented, the site will be published on a domain name.

TODO:
- Implement all existing frontend functionality from original site, with substantial UI/UX changes
- Write backend side(separate repository, using C# or Python)
- Add social media integrations
