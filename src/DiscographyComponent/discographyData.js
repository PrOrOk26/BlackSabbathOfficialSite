          What is this that stands before me
          Figure in black which points at me

          Telling people their desire

          What is this that stands before me
          Figure in black which points at me

          Find out I’m the chosen one. Oh no!

          Big black shape with eyes of fire
          Telling people their desire
          Satan sitting there he’s smiling
          Watch those flames get higher and higher.
          Oh no, no
          Please God help me!

          Satan’s coming round the bend
          People running ’cause they’re scared
          You people better go and beware
          No! No! Please! No!
